                <h2 class="display-4">what is P2P</h2>
                <p>
                    Procure-to-Pay (P2P) is a business process that involves the purchase of goods or services by an organization, 
                    from identifying the need to make a purchase, through the procurement process, up to the payment to the vendor or
                    supplier. The process starts with identifying the need for goods or services, which can be initiated by a requisition 
                    from a department or an employee. The requisition then goes through the approval process, which can involve multiple 
                    levels of approval based on the amount or type of goods or services being purchased.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the requisition is approved, it becomes a Purchase Order (PO), which is a legally binding agreement between 
                    the buyer and the vendor or supplier. The PO contains details such as the quantity, price, delivery date, and payment 
                    terms of the purchase. The vendor or supplier then delivers the goods or services, which are received and verified by 
                    the buyer. The buyer then approves the invoice from the vendor or supplier, and the payment is made based on the terms 
                    and conditions specified in the PO. 
                </p>                
                <p>
                    The P2P process involves different stakeholders within an organization, such as procurement, finance, and accounts 
                    payable departments. Each stakeholder plays a critical role in ensuring that the process runs smoothly and efficiently. 
                    The procurement department is responsible for identifying the need for goods or services and initiating the requisition 
                    process. The finance department is responsible for ensuring that the purchase is within budget and the payment terms are 
                    favorable to the organization. The accounts payable department is responsible for processing the invoices and making the 
                    payment to the vendor or supplier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An efficient P2P process can provide several benefits to an organization, such as cost savings, reduced cycle time, 
                    increased visibility, and improved supplier relationships. Cost savings can be achieved by negotiating favorable terms 
                    with suppliers, optimizing the procurement process, and reducing errors and discrepancies in the invoicing and payment 
                    process. Reduced cycle time can be achieved by streamlining the procurement and payment processes, automating manual 
                    tasks, and leveraging technology. Increased visibility can be achieved by having a centralized system that tracks the 
                    entire P2P process and provides real-time information to all stakeholders. Improved supplier relationships can be 
                    achieved by ensuring timely payments, resolving issues and disputes quickly, and providing feedback to suppliers.
